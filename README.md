This is the AeonProcessCreation Plugin for Goobi workflow. It allows to create multiple Goobi processes based on an AEON request.

This is a plugin for Goobi workflow, the open source workflow tracking software for digitisation projects. More information about Goobi workflow is available under https://goobi.io. If you want to get in touch with the user community simply go to https://community.goobi.io.

## Getting Started

To get the Plugin up and running in its current state, please follow instructions below:

1. Copy `RestTest.java` into `org/goobi/api/rest` for rest api functionality
2. Add piece of code to `/opt/digiverso/goobi/config/goobi_rest.xml` to allow access to rest api

```html
<endpoint path="/testingRest.*">
    <method name="get">
        <allow />
    </method>
    <method name="post">
        <allow />
    </method>
</endpoint>
```

3. Start goobi and the plugin should be functional

**Important**

aeon attributes in the config xml of the plugin **have** to be paths of JSON sub objects to needed property!
Example if JSON transmission response is built like this:

```JSON
{
    "id":"1234",
    "user":{
        "name":"Maxim"
    },
    "items":[
        { "id":"1", "title":"Hello"}
    ]
}
```

So to map the information in the config correctly the desired fields would **have** to be inside `<transmission>`!
For example to access:

- id: `<field aeon="id">`
- name of user: `<field aeon="user.name">`

to map the items, the desired fields **have** to be defined in `<processes>` and assume that `item` is the base object!
So for example to access:

- items id: `<field aeon="id">`
- items title: `<field aeon="title">`

This is because the Java backend objects will be mapped according to the JSON response! 
The main transmission information and item information will be handled seperately.

## Problems

* no messages in the form of `#{msgs. ...}` added yet, every text is hardcoded
* java objects are designed for pseudo JSON code sent by rest api
* no implementation of properties box
